#Birthquakes: React Edition

This is a rebuild of the _*Earthscope*_ project's "Birthquakes" webapp, which was previously built in raw HTML/CSS/JS.

###Dependencies:

1. react (duh)
1. react-leaflet
1. react-date-picker

###Quick Start:

This project was built in [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for package management.

To build for the first time in a dev environment with a local server, run:

```

git clone git@github.com:porkloin/bq

cd bq

yarn install

yarnpkg start

```
